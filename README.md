--- RAIL FENCE CIPHER PROGRAM by PARROTFLAKES ---

The Rail Fence Cipher goes as follows:

You have your plaintext - for example, 'HERECOMEDATBOI'

You designate a 'row' number. This is what both parties, recieving and ending, agree on.
This step is crucial in keeping the message from being decrypted by unwanted parties.
The most common row number is 3.

You write your plaintext in a zig-zag pattern with the pre-designated number of rows and
write the ciphertext as you would English: left to write, top to bottom.

H   C   D   O
 E E O E A B I
  R   M   T
