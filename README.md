Read up on the Rail Fence cipher:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence_cipher

This is a program written by scratch over the course of several days. It is

that anyone use this encryption method due to its simplicity and potential 
to be easily decrypted by third parties, particularly by brute force.
